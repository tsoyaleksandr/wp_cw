          <h1>History</h1>
          <span>The history of the company begins with its founder, Khusamiddin Kayumov. In 2006, Husamiddin and his partners founded the Burger company. The first outlet was opened at the bus stop complex – this is how the family business of selling lavash, burgers and other fast food products began. Since then, the company has started to gain invaluable experience every day and make really delicious and beloved pita bread. The assortment of dishes was constantly replenished, there were more and more buyers – more and more people could adequately appreciate the quality of dishes made with love and conscientiously. And then, when the company was just starting its journey, there was a dream, an idea or even a thirst to create something unlike anything else, innovative and useful! It was with such goals that the development of the company took place.

Creating a corporate culture, we tried to surround ourselves with like-minded people - those who share our principles and values. Especially appreciated those who will not leave the company in the most difficult times and will continue to believe in its success and do everything to come to it and take new heights! .

By the way, the first branch, now the EVOS Yunusabad restaurant, is successfully functioning to this day!</span>
