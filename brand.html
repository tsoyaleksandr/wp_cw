          <h1>Brand</h1>
          <span>In 2011, the company changed its name and became known as EVOS – as a reflection of the global goal of innovation and evolution in everything – in the assortment and quality of new dishes, in the ever-growing requirements for the quality of service, to the qualifications of staff. Every day brought more and more experience, and with it increased the demands on processes and the desire to achieve new goals. Our global goal today is to become the first Uzbek brand in the QSR (quick service restaurant) category, known all over the world. We intend to create the largest national catering network - a favorite place of our guests of all ages. Every day we observe how the number of satisfied visitors is growing – and this is the result of daily work. We make sure that our products should be accessible to everyone, and the quality and service culture should be impeccable.
The mission of EVOS is a network of convenient establishments with high–quality, affordable food, where every guest enjoys a hospitable meeting and delicious food, after which he leaves satisfied and soon returns – bringing friends and family with him.



- Service to society: we produce high–quality goods at affordable prices, bring benefits to people, saving them time for cooking - we have really tasty, fast and natural.

- Continuous self-improvement: every day we strive to improve both our products and internal business processes that contribute to achieving the highest possible results in order to meet the mission and achieve the global goal of the company

- Ethics of relationships: in building any relationship, be it guests of our restaurants, business partners or employees of the company, we strive to maintain the principles of mutual respect, openness, honesty and reliability. Thanks to this, over the many years that the company has been on the market, we have been able to win and secure the status of a favorite institution among a large number of our countrymen, a reliable and long-term partner in business circles, and a responsible and stable employer in the eyes of our employees and potential applicants.</span>
