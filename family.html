          <h1>Family</h1>
          <span>New branches began to appear, the team grew, but despite the number - we are one big family! We support and are a support for each other. We try to create an atmosphere where a person, namely our EMPLOYEE, would be at the center of everything. We respect every opinion and value action. We don't need to be afraid or pick a convenient moment to voice our idea. Each of our employees knows for sure that thanks to the open door policy, you can approach any colleague with a question or suggestion. In our company, he sees individuals in people, and not a tool for solving operational tasks. Each of us can grow professionally and such cases are not uncommon. We get special pleasure when we tell our friends that we work at EVOS, while each of them already knows about our restaurants and delicious food!
Our priority is the growth of the company through personal development. We welcome and support the desire of employees for self-development and promotion.
We never forget to adhere to the main principle that we are all one big family of EVOS Oilasi, where every employee is an important and integral part of the overall success of the company.
We are rightfully proud that today our company is one of the largest employers for students, people with disabilities and youth of Uzbekistan, thanks to the conditions that we create for our employees. We are also particularly proud and attentive to the implementation of projects of social significance. We sincerely believe that each of us can make the world a little kinder if we just start with ourselves. And when we combine our efforts and direct them into a common good cause, the results exceed even the wildest expectations!</span>
