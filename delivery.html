          <h1>Delivery</h1>
          <span>EVOS is actively developing the delivery direction - it saves time, quickly and conveniently. Moreover, it is one of the mandatory elements of the service, which is always highly appreciated and in demand by the buyer. Today we are rightfully proud that our delivery is one of the fastest in Uzbekistan. For example, the average delivery time in the city of Tashkent from the moment of receiving the order is only 15-20 minutes.
The delivery system is built in such a way that it is easy and convenient for the buyer to use the order system and quickly receive dishes from any nearest restaurant in our network.

It is important for us that in every EVOS restaurant people receive the same high-quality service and product. To achieve such a result, standards have been introduced into the management of the system, according to which all our employees work.

Delivery of your favorite dishes from EVOS is fast and convenient! You can order delivery not only by phone, but also on the website, through a mobile application and a telegram bot - every buyer will definitely find the most convenient way to order.
One of the important and convenient moments, especially for those who are hungry late at night and at night – we accept your orders until 03.00 hours!</span>
